Color Detection
===========================

PiCar-X is a Robot with Camera. Ezblock also provides some object detection functions. Here we try color detection. Prior to this, you must ensure that the Pi Camera 
FFC cable is properly and securely connected.

Here we drag a Video from the Bluetooth Control page, and it will generate a monitor.

You need to open the image in Video by setting Camera start to true. Setting it to false will close the image (but not object detection).

You can use this block to switch the color detected by the color detection. Only one color can be detected for one time.
