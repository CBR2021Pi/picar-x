Orienteering
==================

Put PiCar-X on a scavenger hunt!

Set up a scene with six markers (maze, square, room, race track) and place a color card in each of the six markers.


We trained 6 color models for PiCar-X, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. You can print them yourself, but you need to make sure they are printed in color.

.. note::

    Please understand that the printed traffic sign cardboard may be a little different from the one we trained because of the color difference or material, which will lead to a less accurate recognition.

Place PiCar-X in the middle of the field and click the Button on the Remote Control page to start the game.

PiCar-X will be given a task - to find the three colors in turn. At the same time, PiCar-X will tell you which color you are looking for using the voice function.
Your task is to help it complete the task in as short a time as possible.

You can take turns playing this game with your friends to see who can help PiCar-X complete the task faster.
