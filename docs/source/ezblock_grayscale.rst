Test Grayscale Module
==============================

PiCar-X has a Grayscale sensor modulefor your implementing some fun experiments, such as walking along the line, detecting cliffs and so on. Its three detection 
probes will read the value according to the detected color shades, such as pure black reading is "0".

You can use this block to read the value of one of the probes of the Grayscale module.

You may want to use **List** block to simplify your program. When you need to store the values of the three probes of Grayscale module, you do not have to set three variables. Set one as a List.
