Say Hello
===================

This project will combine several functions from the preceding projects. The PiCar-X movement will be remotely controlled, and the PiCar’s camera will be remotely controlled by using two joystick controllers. When PiCar recognizes someone's face, it will nod politely and then say “Hello!”.

The **if do** block is used to nod politely once the conditional judgment of “if” is true.
