Play with Ezblock
===========================

**Ezblock** is a software development platform created by SunFounder for helping beginners and novices get started with programming on a Raspberry Pi platform. 
Ezbock has two programming language environments: a Graphical User Interface environment, and a command-line Python environment. 

Ezblock is available for nearly all types of devices, including Mac, PC, and Android. 
Ezblock has recently been upgraded to version 3.0, which uses WebSocket to provide Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support.

Please refer to the following tutorials to learn to adjust the the servo's angle to 0 during assembly and to install Ezblock Studio.

**Projects**


This section begins with basic programming functions for the PiCar-X, and continues through to creating more advanced programs in Ezblock Studio. 
Each tutorial contains TIPS that introduce new functions, allowing users to write the corresponding program. 
There is also a complete reference code in the Example section that can be directly used. 
We suggest attempting the programming without using the code in the Example sections, and enjoy the fun experience of overcoming the challenges!

All of the Ezblock projects have been uploaded to Ezblock Studioâ€™s Examples page. From the Examples page, users can run the programs directly, or edit the examples and save them into the users My Projects folder.

The Examples page allows users to choose between Block or Python language. The projects in this section only explain Block language, for an explanation of the Python code, please review this `file <https://github.com/sunfounder/picar-x/blob/v2.0/docs/(EN)%20picarmini.md>`_ to help you understand the Python code.
