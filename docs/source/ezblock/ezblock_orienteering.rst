Orienteering
==================

This project uses the remote control function to guide the PiCar-X through a competitive scavenger hunt!

First, set up either an obstacle course, or a maze, or even an empty room that the PiCar-X can drive through. Then, randomly place six markers along the route, and put a color-card at each of the six markers for the PiCar-X to find. 

The six color models for PiCar-X are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple, and are ready to print from a colored printer from the PDF below.

.. note::

    The printed colors may have a slightly different hue from the Ezblock color models due to printer toner differences, or the printed medium, such as a tan-colored paper. This can cause a less accurate color recognition.

The PiCar-X will be programmed to find three of the six colors in a random order, and will be using the TTS function to announce which color to look for next.

The objective is to help the PiCar-X find each of the three colors in as short of a time as possible.

Place PiCar-X in the middle of the field and click the Button on the Remote Control page to start the game.
