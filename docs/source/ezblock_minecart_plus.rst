Minecart Plus
=======================

In this project, derailment recovery has been added to the :ref:`Minecart` project to let the PiCar-X adapt and recover from a more severe curve.

**TIPS**

Use another **to do something** block to allow the PiCar-X to back up and recover from a sharp curve. 
Note that the new **to do something** function does not return any values, but is used just for reorienting the PiCar-X.
