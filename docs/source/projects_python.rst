**How to Run the Code File**


Open the **example** folder you downloaded earlier, and you will see some python code in it.

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/picar-x/examples

You can run the python codes by the following command:

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 FILENAME.py

You can start the corresponding code by changing ``FILENAME.py`` to a specific example.
