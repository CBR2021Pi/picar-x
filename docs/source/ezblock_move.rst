Move
============

First we need to know how to make PiCar-X move. Here, we let it perform the five actions of "forward", "backward", "turn left", "turn right", and "stop" in order.

Before that, you can learn the basic usage of Ezblock Studio from here.

This block makes PiCar-X move at a certain speed, a percentage of power. Just like "50" is a half-speed.

This block makes your PiCar-X back at a certain speed, which is also a percentage of power.

This block can adjust the front wheels’ orientation. The range is "-45"~"45". Such as "-30" means wheels deviate 30° to the left.
