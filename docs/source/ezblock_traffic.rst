Traffic Sign Detection
===============================

In this example, traffic sign recognition is added premised on automatic driving ( :ref:`Minecart` ). To put it another way, PiCar-X will still drive along the road, but the condition to change its driving and stopping state will no longer be the obstacle ahead, but the traffic sign on the roadside.

Here, it is detected that the **STOP** sign will stop it, and that the **Forward** sign will make it drive forward.

Its working logic is also applicable to other target detection missions (such as color recognition, which is used to detect traffic lights). When you turn on the video, you can see how PiCar-X completes the detection mission.

**TIPS**
