Welcome to PiCar-X's documentation!
===================================

Thanks for choosing our PiCar-X.

PiCar-X is an AI self-driving robot car for Raspberry Pi, on which RPi works as the 
control center. The mounted camera module, ultrasonic module, line tracking module 
can separately realize the functions of color detection, face detection, automatic 
obstacle avoidance, automatic line tracking, etc.

For this article, your are suggested to follow the reading order as below:

1. :ref:'Introduction', learn about the background of PiCar-X and automatic driving.
#. Check that your parts are not missing.
#. Building the PiCar-x.

   .. note:: When carrying out the construction of the trolley (to the step of installing steering gear), you will be required to finish: :ref:'Quick Guide on Ezblock' or :ref:'Quick Guide on Python'. Definitely, you can also finish one of the Quick Guides prior to assembling.

#. Check :ref:'Ezblock Project' or :ref:'Python Project'.

Where there arises a problem, please check: :ref:'FAQ' or send an email to service@sunfounder.com.


**Two Ways to Play**


If you wish to avoid difficult and obscure coding and play PiCar-X as soon as possible, you can use it directly based on Ezblock. It will require you to finish the configuration as instructed in :ref:'Quick Guide on Ezblock' - 
Ezblock Studio is a development platform developed by SunFounder designed for beginners to lower the barriers to getting started with Raspberry Pi. 
It has two programming languages: Graphical and Python, and available on almost all different types of devices. 
With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support, you can download code, remote control a Raspberry Pi, on Ezblock Studio.

If you are more suitable for traditional programming users, we suggest you use Python-based gameplay, which will require you to have a good command of basic Python programming skills and basic knowledge of Linux operating system.
Please follow the instruction: ref:'Quick Guide on Python', and configure the environment suitable for PiCar-X operation from the original Raspberry Pi OS.
